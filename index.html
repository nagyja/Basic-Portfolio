			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="bio">
				Raised in the barren wastelands of West Texas from an early age I was bored. Boredom and idolness made for a restless mind and I had to learn to keep myself entertained. I desired to make, and making requires understanding. Reading, tinkering, and breaking things became the normal course. I moved to Philidelphia to study mechanidcal engineering. Upon completing my degree I found work with a consumer product manufacturer, but quickly moved on to working in the defense industry as a fuze and warhead design engineer where my skills in reading, tinkering, and breaking were put to full use.
